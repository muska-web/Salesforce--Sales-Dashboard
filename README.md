# Salesforce--Sales-Dashboard
📊 Salesforce Sales Forecasting Dashboard
Platform: Salesforce

📘 Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a customized Salesforce dashboard designed to enhance visibility into sales performance and improve forecasting accuracy. The dashboard focuses on contract value by sales leaders and opportunities expected to close in the current and upcoming month.

🎯 Objective (STAR Method)
Situation: Sales leadership lacked clear visibility into performance metrics and upcoming opportunities, affecting forecasting accuracy and planning.

Task: Design and implement a Salesforce dashboard to display key sales data in a clear, visual format for timely and informed decision-making.

Action:

Created two custom visualizations in Salesforce:

Total Contract Value by Sales Leader – Sorted view to compare individual performance.

Upcoming Opportunities – Opportunities filtered by expected contract signature dates (this and next month).

Configured filters and layout to allow interactive, role-based insights.

Result: Enabled leadership to track performance at a glance and proactively manage sales pipelines, significantly improving forecasting precision.
